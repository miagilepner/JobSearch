# JobSearch - A Chrome Extension
While scouring the internet for suitable internships, I found myself annoyed at how hard it was to find the "Careers" page on many websites. This extension solves the issue by scanning links on the page and performing string matching to determine if the link directs to a Jobs portal. The link is available in the extension popup window. 

Happy job hunting!
